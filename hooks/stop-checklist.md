Before stopping, check:
- Root cause identified? (Not just symptoms — why does the problem exist?)
- If blaming external code: did you read its source, reproduce in isolation, find the exact cause?
- Investigation complete? (Don't ask permission to investigate — just do it.)
- If blocked: stated exactly what's missing and what you tried?

If any check fails → continue working. Stop only if all pass.
